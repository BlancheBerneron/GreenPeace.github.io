## Where are we standing? 

>“Global warming is likely to be the greatest threat of the 21st century.” 

As you all know, climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts can be natural, such as through variations in the solar cycle. 
Nevertheless, since the 1800s, human activities have been the [main driver of climate change](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2018/12/ST1.5_OCE_LR.pdf), more precisely in global warming. Indeed, in the last decades we observe a general increase in average temperatures of the Earth, which modifies the weather balances and ecosystems. 
Activities such as burning fossil fuels generate greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket wrapped around the Earth, trapping the sun’s heat and raising temperatures.

At the pace of current CO2 emissions, scientists expect an increase of between 1.5° and 5.3°C in average temperature by 2100. If no action is taken, it would have harmful consequences to humanity and the biosphere. 

If you encounter climate skeptics in your way, you will find useful arguments [here](https://350.org/fr/). 


## Why it is important to create campains? 

All these previous scientestics facts need to be vulgarized and reach the general population to all act in an eco-responsible way in their daily life.  Public awareness is important to increase enthusiasm and support, stimulate self-mobilisation and action, and mobilise local knowledge and resources. Raising political awareness is important as policy makers and politicians are key actors in the policy process of adaptation. 

## What are the first question to ask ourself? 



## Let’s check what the data of quotes says! 



**Here is some bold text**

## Here is a secondary heading

Here's a useless table:

| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |


How about a yummy crepe?

![Crepe](https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cQ1Yoa75m2yUFFbY2xwuqw/348s.jpg)

It can also be centered!

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes
You can add notification, warning and error boxes like this:

### Notification

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** This is a warning box.

### Error

{: .box-error}
**Error:** This is an error box.
