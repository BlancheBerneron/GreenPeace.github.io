>“Global warming is likely to be the greatest threat of the 21st century.” 

As you all know, climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts can be natural, such as through variations in the solar cycle. 
Nevertheless, since the 1800s, human activities have been the [main driver of climate change](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2018/12/ST1.5_OCE_LR.pdf), more precisely in global warming. Indeed, in the last decades we observe a general increase in average temperatures of the Earth, which modifies the weather balances and ecosystems. At the pace of current CO2 emissions, scientists expect an increase of between 1.5° and 5.3°C in average temperature by 2100. If no action is taken, it would have harmful consequences to humanity and the biosphere. 

If you encounter climate skeptics in your way, you will find useful arguments [here](https://350.org/fr/). 

All these previous scientific facts need to be vulgarized and reach the general population to all act in an eco-responsible way in their daily life.  Public awareness is important to increase enthusiasm and support, simulate self-mobilisation and action, and mobilise local knowledge and resources. Raising political awareness is important as policy makers and politicians are key actors in the policy process of adaptation. 

## Goal

We want to create a productive awareness campaign about Climate Change. Thanks to “Quotebank '' database and open accessible data, our goal is to understand how the Climate Change topic has been appropriated by society in the last 5 years. In other words, when do we talk about it, who and in which platform? This article should serve as a head start for people searching how to target the Climate Change awareness campaign.

## Research Questions
During this article we will anwser to the following questions:
* What were the topics and events that triggered conversation about Climate Change?
* Who are the main personalities driving Climate Change topic? 
* Are there medias appropriating Climate Change theme? Is Climate Change "IN"? 

## How we did it
We built our dataset from Quotebank, an open corpus of 178 million quotations attributed to the speakers who uttered them, extracted from 162 million English news articles published between 2008 and 2020. Additionally, we only take Climate Change

We wanted to have as much data as possible to have an accurate analysis. So we have in total: 


       Quotes                            Speakers                            Domains  
       142'238                            50'154                              6'673 


#### Let’s check now what the data has to say...
