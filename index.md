Dear Jennifer Morgan,

We want to thank you for letting us take on the challenge of better understanding the climate change landscape in the news. We believe that this data-driven approach can complement Greenpeace’s existing, more qualitative, methods and provide you with a coherent understanding of how the climate change discourse has evolved within the news. After three months of extensive research, we have reached the point where our findings will bring a tangible improvement to Greenpeace’s core mission: <core mission>.

## Goal
We want to create a productive awareness campaign about Climate Change. Thanks to “Quotebank '' database and open accessible data, our goal is to understand how the Climate Change topic has been appropriated by society in the last 5 years. In other words, when do we talk about it, who and in which platform? This article should serve as a head start for people searching how to target the Climate Change awareness campaign.

## Research Questions
During this article we will anwser to the following questions:
* What were the topics and events that triggered conversation about Climate Change?
* Who are the main personalities driving Climate Change topic? 
* Are there medias appropriating Climate Change theme? Is Climate Change "IN"? 

## How we did it
We built our dataset from Quotebank, an open corpus of 178 million quotations attributed to the speakers who uttered them, extracted from 162 million English news articles published between 2008 and 2020. Additionally, we only take Climate Change

We wanted to have as much data as possible to have an accurate analysis. So we have in total: 


       Quotes                            Speakers                            Domains  
       142'238                            50'154                              6'673 


#### Let’s check now what the data has to say... 


<center> <h1>Is conversion about Climate Change constant over time?</h1> </center>

{: .box-note}
**Assumption:** There is a linear relationship between quotes and articles in online newspapers. Thus if we interchange both words, don't be surprised. 

### Frecuency of Climate Change Quotes 
Graph occurences through time
Do Climate Change quotes appear in the frequency though time? No! There is a heterogenouty, either quotes are published hundred of times in differents news papers either they appear few time. How come? 

Let's start really brodly by analysing the evolution of climate change quotes in the last 5 years. 

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/8162290"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
       
The majors peaks observed on the graph are the following: 
     
* April 2017 : Accordint to WikiTimeline on 28th March "U.S. President Trump signs an executive order undoing former President Obama's climate change policies"
* November 2015 : According to WikiTimeline "Pope Francis encourages bishops from around the world to sign an appeal to world leaders, meeting in Paris next month, for crucial climate change talks." 
* September 2019:  According to WikiTimeline "Millions of young people take to the streets and numerous businesses worldwide go on strike days before the UN Climate Summit, demanding that further action be taken to confront climate change." 

Can we trust our guts? Let's find out. 
       
 (A major pic appears in April 2017, what happend then?  --> to keep?) 
### Main Topics of Climate Change 
 
{: .box-note}
**Side Note:** Thanks to LDA we are aible to determine different topics in Climate Change Quotes!

 **Figure x:** Topics generated by LDA algorithme with constraint: 30 topics to find.
 
### Is there a difference on frequency before and after X event?
 Know that we know the 
       
Let's check is this fatadic month really brought more concern in the media, and thus climate change quotes where more published?

This could already give us a hint of topics that people are interestd about! 

Are there topics that appear in a pattern? 

<center> <h1>Who talks about Climate Change? </h1> </center>

Let’s now look into people that are most quoted in relation to Climate Change from the past 5 years.
_Are the most quoted people for Climate Change talk only about Climate Change?_

<div align="center" style="text-align:center">
<table align="center" style="text-align:center">
 <tr><th>Position  </th> <th>Speaker</th>         <th>% over all Speaker quotes </th></tr>
 <tr><td> 1 </td>   <td> Barack Obama </td>        <td> 32.8 % </td></tr>
 <tr><td> 2 </td>   <td> Bernie Sanders </td>      <td> 40.9 % </td></tr>
 <tr><td> 3 </td>   <td> Donald Trump  </td>       <td> 16.4 % </td></tr>
 <tr><td> 4 </td>   <td> Narendra Modi  </td>      <td> 29.4 % </td></tr>
 <tr><td> 5 </td>   <td> António Guterres </td>    <td> 27.7 % </td></tr>
 <tr><td> 6 </td>   <td> Jay Inslee</td>           <td> 29.8 % </td></tr>
 <tr><td> 7 </td>   <td> Michael Mann </td>        <td> 40.3 % </td></tr>
 <tr><td> 8 </td>   <td> Justin Trudeau  </td>     <td> 19.4 % </td></tr>
 <tr><td> 9 </td>   <td> Jerry Brown </td>         <td> 20.4 % </td></tr>
 <tr><td> 10 </td>  <td> Al Gore </td>             <td> 24.5 % </td></tr>
 </table>   
 </div>
 
 **Table 1:** Top most quoted speaker and their percentage of citation on Climate Change out of their total citation. 

It seems that is not the case, but still it is a hot topic! 

Do you see a trend between most quoted speakers? 
       
You wan't to say that Politics speakes more about Climate change, right? 
But if we observe Occupations of most quoted speakers about Climate Chnage over top occupation of most quoted speakers we have the following graph: 
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-hierarchy" data-src="visualisation/8163210"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

Politics are not significant quoted!     
       
Ok, this wasn't faire, what about Nationality? 
       
       
And Religion?       
       
#### Connecting speakers and sites in an **al-gore-itmic embedding**.

 ADD A IMAGE WITH PLOT OF DIFFERENTS FEATURES 
The “type” person that is most quoted about the climate change is: 
 
ADD IMAGE PEARSON WITH PIE CHARTS OF OCCUPATION, SEX, NATIONALITY,  RACE AND RELEGION

Most people quoted seem to be political. Indeed the following graph will show you what the occupation of most quoted people is. But let’s go further 


(tals about politics? Embedding? ) 

Ok, so in conclusion if you are  politic with this and this age nationality and , be sure that you will be hearded.

Finally, what will be the most eficient media to talk about Climate Change? 
Is it _Time_ as the poster could advance? 



Let's play with embeddings, the hottest thing of the century !
