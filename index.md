# Where are we standing and why it is important to create campains? 

>“Global warming is likely to be the greatest threat of the 21st century.” 

As you all know, climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts can be natural, such as through variations in the solar cycle. 
Nevertheless, since the 1800s, human activities have been the [main driver of climate change](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2018/12/ST1.5_OCE_LR.pdf), more precisely in global warming. Indeed, in the last decades we observe a general increase in average temperatures of the Earth, which modifies the weather balances and ecosystems. 
Activities such as burning fossil fuels generate greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket wrapped around the Earth, trapping the sun’s heat and raising temperatures.

At the pace of current CO2 emissions, scientists expect an increase of between 1.5° and 5.3°C in average temperature by 2100. If no action is taken, it would have harmful consequences to humanity and the biosphere. 

If you encounter climate skeptics in your way, you will find useful arguments [here](https://350.org/fr/). 

All these previous scientestics facts need to be vulgarized and reach the general population to all act in an eco-responsible way in their daily life.  Public awareness is important to increase enthusiasm and support, stimulate self-mobilisation and action, and mobilise local knowledge and resources. Raising political awareness is important as policy makers and politicians are key actors in the policy process of adaptation. 

## Goal

We want to create a productive awareness campaign about Climate Change. Thanks to “Quotebank '' database and open accessible data, our goal is to understand how the Climate Change topic has been appropriated by society in the last 5 years. In other words, when do we talk about it, who and in which platform? This article should serve as a head start for people searching how to target the Climate Change awareness campaign.

## Key Insights (Research Question) or answer of the research question
During this article we will find:
What are the topics that trigger conversation about CC.
Barack Obama seems the guru of… Who is talking about it in the media. ….. …. Let’s check what the data of quotes says!

## How we did it
We wanted to have as much data as possible to have an accurate analysis. So we built our dataset from:

### Let’s check now what the data has to say. 


# Which events triggers conversion about Climate Change? 

{: .box-note}
**Assumption:** There is a linear relationship between quotes and articles in online newspapers. 
Let's start really brodly by analysing the evolution of climate change quotes in the last 5 years. 

GRAPH Time VS number of quotes

We observe already 3 straigth forward pics and a periode of lots of variation. By searching online we observe cosality, by introducing the 

### What are the topic trough time?

</div>

### What are the relationship between trigerring events? 

This could already give us a hint of topics that people are interestd about! 


## Who talks about Climate Change? 

Let’s now look into people that are most quoted in relation to Climate Change from the past 5 years.

Most quoted people in absolute value are…

If indeed, if this time we use the proportion of all dataset we observe that:
